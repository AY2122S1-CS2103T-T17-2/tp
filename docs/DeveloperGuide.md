**`CLITutors`** is a desktop app for **managing private tutoring jobs**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have a big list of tutors to manage, `CLITutors` helps you to manage matching tutors and students for private tuition faster than using a regular database.

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![LogicClassDiagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete s 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections on the next few pages will give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component
**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

Here's a class diagram of the `UI` component:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities
between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
The `PersonListPanel` is split up into `TutorCard` and `StudentCard` on the UI as 3 lists: Tutor List, Student List, and Match List (containing Tutor entries only).

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic Class Diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete s 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/tracing/LogicSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Taking a deeper look into the classes in `Logic` that are used for parsing a user command:

![Insert class diagram for Parser component](images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

Here's a class diagram of the `Model` component:

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Tutor` and `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorList` and `UniqueStudentList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tutor` and `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutor>` and `ObservableList<Student>` respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Tutor` and `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Tutor` and `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>

### Storage component
**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

Here's a class diagram of the `Storage` component:

![Storage component diagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature
#### What it is
#### Implementation details

### Delete feature
#### What it is
Deletes the tutor or student at the specified `INDEX` from the displayed tutor/student list.

#### Implementation details
Similar to the `AddCommand` class above, the `DeleteCommand` class extends the `Command` class. The actual execution of the `delete` command is similar to that of the `add` command, except the `delete` command decides on the tutor/student to delete based on the `INDEX` of the tutor/student displayed on the `filteredTutors` list or the `filteredStudents` list of the `ModelManager` class.

##### Sequence of action
{:.no_toc}

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `delete` command implementation behaves at each step:

1. The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to parse the given user input. 
2. The `AddressBookParser` identifies the user command (`delete`) and creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` object. It then calls `DeleteCommandParser#parse` with the command arguments as the parameter.
3. `DeleteCommandParser` then generates a `DeleteCommand` object with the `INDEX` (of the tutor/student to be deleted) and `PersonType` as parameters.
4. As the `PersonType` is a tutor, `DeleteCommand` retrieves the `Tutor` (to be deleted) from the `filteredTutors` list of the `ModelManager`. `DeleteCommand` will then call `Model#deleteTutor`, which will delete the tutor from the tutor list.
5. Lastly, a new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Given below is a sequence diagram to show how the `delete` implementation works for a **valid** `delete` tutor input:

![DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Given below is an activity diagram to show how the `delete` command works for a **valid** `delete` tutor input:

![DeleteCommandActivityDiagram](images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect: How `delete` is executed
{:.no_toc}

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: User can `delete` only one tutor/student at a time.
    - Pros: Reduces the lack of potential errors due to the decreased complexity of the code. It is also easier to implement since there are lesser use cases to consider.
    - Cons: It is less intuitive for the user as they are now limited by having to `delete` each tutor/student one by one.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** In our current implementation, Users can delete all tutors/students from their respective lists using the `clear` command. This is to make the app more intuitive for users with clear goals on the command they want to execute while reducing any unnecessary complexity in our `delete` command. 
</div>

- **Alternative 2**: User can `delete` multiple tutors/students using the command at the same time.
    - Pros: Allows the user more flexibility in deleting tutors/students instead of just deleting them one by one.
      For example, users can choose to `delete` one or many tutors/students, depending on their command input.
    - Cons: This will cause the code to become more complex in dealing with many possible inputs and scenarios, leading to a higher amount of potential errors.
